Welcome to the Shardeum Dapp Boilerplate ! This is a comprehensive starting point for rapid prototyping your ideas on Shardeum.

This boilerplate is great for:

✅ Learning Blockchain fundmentals

✅ Hackathon participants

✅ Experiencing Shardeum

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can easily create your Shardeum decentralized applications by using the following command:

```bash
npx create-shardeum-dapp my-dapp
```

## 📖 Usecases

There are three primary modules in the boilerplate:

- RPC: This module demonstrates the functionality of an Shardeum RPC. Be in reading useful data from the blockchain or sending transactions, rpcs serve as a gateway to the blockchain.

- NFT Minting: This module demonstrates a basic NFT minting page which let's user mint NFTs for a fixed mint price.

- DeFi: This module demonstrate the use of Uniswap V2 to swap between two tokens.

## 🛠️ Layout

- **Header**: An easily configurable header with wallet connect functionality along with displaying user address and balance.

- **Pages**: Individual pages for demonstrating functionality for 3 major verticals in web3 - RPC, NFT and Defi.

- **Smart Contracts**: All primary smart contracts used in the application can be found in the '**contracts**' directory and the appropriate scripts in the '**scripts**' directory.
